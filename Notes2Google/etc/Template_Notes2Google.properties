# This file contains runtime configuration data for the CalendarSync-Tool.
#
# All values (unless otherwise noted) are reloaded at regular intervals, so it is
# possible to change values here without the need to restart the Calendars Main-Loop itself.
#
# IMPORTANT: CHECK ALL VALUES STARTING WITH "<setup"
# You should also check the filters (given as javascript files, probably in the same 
# directory as this file)

# How often shall the source calendar be checked for changes (in minutes) during officehours?

# ------------------------------ Source Calendar settings ----------------------------
# The class of calendar to be read from. Choose only ONE of the following!
#
calendar.from=de.mbaaba.iCal.ICalCalendar 
#calendar.from=de.mbaaba.fileCal.FileCalendar
#calendar.from=de.mbaaba.google.GoogleCalendar
#calendar.from=de.mbaaba.notes.NotesCalendar


# ------------------------------ Target Calendar settings ----------------------------
# The class of calendar to be written to. Choose only ONE of the following!
#

# ------------------------------ Filter settings -------------------------------------
# A list of filters that will be applied to each calendar entry as it is processed.
# These filters must be given as a comma seperated list with either an absolute path-name, or relative 
# to the working directory. Examples:
# 
#filters.scripts=../etc/filterBySubject.js,../etc/removeBody.js
filters.scripts=<setup-your-filters>


# ------------------------------ Google settings -------------------------------------
# The following settings are specific for the google calendar.
#
# The ID of the calendar that shall be used. You may have multiple "sub" calendars in your google calendar,
# and it is probably a good idea to use one dedicated calendar for the synchronization (just in case something goes badly wrong, 'ya know!)
# If you're brave and don't want to use a sub-calendar, you may use the ID "primary". Good luck! 
#google.calendarID=primary
google.calendarID=<set the ID of the calendar that you want to use>




# ------------------------------ iCal settings ---------------------------------------
# Default values for broken calendar entries

#default.location=Kurfürstendamm 1, Berlin
default.location=<setup-your-default-location>


# ------------------------------ iCal settings ---------------------------------------
# The following settings are specific for the iCal calendar.

# The path and name of the iCal file
#ical.filename="c:/data/myCalendar.ics"
ical.filename=<setup-your-iCal-filename>


# ------------------------------ Request timeout -------------------------------------
# Determines the timeout the adapter will wait for every remote action to be completed.
# This takes only effect for pure processing time of the remote web service. If the service
# is not available / reachable the timeout has no effect.
# Default value is 45 seconds to wait.
requestTimeout=45


# ------------------------------ SSL settings ----------------------------------------
# The following value allows you to ignore the content of the HTTPS certificates that we get.
# Set to true here because we are forced to use a proxy.
